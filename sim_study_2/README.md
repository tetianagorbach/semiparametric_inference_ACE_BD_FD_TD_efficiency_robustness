Results includes the results of the simulations after running the simulations on HPC2N.

Rscripts includes the following files:
        
        - job_2.sh provides the parameters and the code used to run the simulation study on the High Performance Computing Center North (HPC2N). To run the code on HPC2N: sbatch job_2.sh when logged in into HPC2N (job_2.sh should be moved to the root directory).
        
        - run_sim_study_2.R provides the code to run the simulation study
        
        - sim_study_2_parameters.R initialises the parameters of the simulation study.
